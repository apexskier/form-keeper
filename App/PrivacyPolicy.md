### How data is used

FormKeeper saves data you or scripts in your browser enter into forms and form fields within websites you grant the extension access to. This data is not transmitted or stored to any external services. All data is stored **locally in your browser** and never shared or uploaded to any third-party service.

### How do I opt-out of data usage?

You can remove currently stored data for an individual web page by navigating to that page in Safari, and using the extension's window to wipe stored data for that page.

You can stop collection of data for individual websites by selecting Deny for those sites in Safari's extension preferences.

You can stop all collection of data by uninstalling the application.

### Security

FormKeeper operates entirely on your device, ensuring that your data remains private. Data is stored within Safari's built-in local storage, and can be read by the website entered on and by other extensions granted storage or read access to that website.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
